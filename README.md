## Installation
To set up this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow keras

## Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammedbilal09/Lung-Cancer-Image-Segmentation.git
cd Lung-Cancer-Image-Segmentation

## Usage
To train the segmentation model, execute the following command:
bash
python train_lung.py --data_path <path_to_dataset> --epochs <number_of_epochs>

For performing inference on new images, use:
bash
python evaluate_performance.py --image_path <path_to_image>

## Dataset
This model requires a dataset of lung cancer images. Recommended datasets include:
LIDC-IDRI
NSCLC Radiogenomics
Organize your dataset in the following structure for optimal performance:
text
dataset/
    ├── images/
    └── masks/

## Model Architecture
The segmentation model is built upon the U-Net architecture, which is effective for biomedical image segmentation. This architecture features an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to maintain spatial context.
